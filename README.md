The purpse of this dashboard is to visually depicted the average happiness score for almost every country in the world, as well as some other parameteres (for detailed explanation on the dashboard elemntes please read the [Data source](https://github.com/LolipopnJoker/Happiness_and_Corruption_Dashboard/blob/main/README.md#data-source) down below).
## Data source
1. ['Happiness and Corruption 2015-2020'](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eliasturk/world-happiness-based-on-cpi-20152020?resource=download) - The data is based on the World Happiness Report published between 2015 and 2020. It was aggregated and preprocessed by [Elias Turk](https://www.kaggle.com/eliasturk).
## Methods
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - I believe that an EDA is the best approach to answering the business problem.
